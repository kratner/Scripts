According to ChatGPT: "As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Matt Ericson was a data journalist and the Deputy Graphics Director at The New York Times. He was known for his work in creating interactive data visualizations and graphics that helped readers better understand complex topics through visual representation. Please note that there might have been developments or changes since then that I am unaware of. If you're looking for the most up-to-date information, I recommend checking The New York Times' official website or other reliable news sources."

### [List Open Files](ListOpenFiles.jsx)

If you open a lot of Illustrator files without closing them, sometimes the windows get out of control, and the menu bar won't show all of the files and it may truncate file names. This script will create a new blank Illustrator file and list your open files for you. _- Keith Ratner_

### [Open Multipage PDF](OpenMultipagePDF.jsx)

This awesome script will extract each page of a PDF file into its own artboard. This is useful for adding electronic signatures and other text to forms. It comes in especially handy if you don't have access to a printer. There are all sorts of other things you can do with the extracted PDF depending on how the PDF was generated.
